Group project
You are allowed to work on these problems in groups of two. Note that the following are just rough ideas. You are free to take your own approach to them. In fact, if you come up with ideas for extensions of the projects, or new ways to solve the problems stated in them, we encourage you to implement them. The grading of this assignment will be on the scale of 0 to 11. (To get an 11 the project has to blow our minds)

Grading for the project will be as follows

(45) Implementation
(30) Scope
(15) Coding style (Pythonic, correct use of functions, consistency, etc.)
(10) Usability (User friendly product and good documentation; comments, readme, etc.)
